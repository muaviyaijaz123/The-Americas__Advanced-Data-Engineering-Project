## Title
Racial Employment and Wage Ratios between Men and Women: Black vs. White

## Main Question
1. What is the impact of education level on wages and employment across black and white population
2. What is the relation between the wage and employment for Men and Women based on their education levels

## Description
This project aims to explore the disparities in wages and employment-to-population ratios across different education levels, focusing on Black and White populations in the USA. By analyzing two key datasets—wages by education level and employment-to-population ratios—this project seeks to investigate how education influences both employment and wage outcomes for men and women, with a specific focus on racial differences.

### Datasets Used:
1. **Wages by Education Level in the USA (1973-2022)**: This dataset provides information on the average wages across various education levels, from high school to advanced degrees, for different demographic groups.
2. **Employment-to-Population Ratio by Education Level(1973-2022)**: This dataset presents the employment-to-population ratio for individuals based on their education level, broken down by race (Black and White) and gender (Men and Women).

### Objectives:
- **Impact of Education on Wages and Employment**: To understand how education level correlates with wages and employment across Black and White populations.
- **Wage and Employment Relation for Men and Women**: To explore how wages and employment rates relate to each other for men and women, based on their education level, and identify any significant disparities based on gender and race.
