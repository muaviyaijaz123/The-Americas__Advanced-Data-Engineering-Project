## Title
Cancer in the United States of America by state: MADE Research Study 2024

## Main Question
Which states in the USA have lowest cancer rates and cancer deaths?

## Description
In America, cancer is one of the leading causes of death. There are multiple factors contributing to it, including unhealthy lifestyle and excess consumption of fast food, tobacco and alcohol. Although mortality rates are decreasing due to advancements in medical technolgy, new types of cancer are also being discovered.

This project compares the cancer statistics across different US states, particularly focusing on identifying the state(s) with lowest cancer rates and deaths. This may help us find helpful patterns for the states with higher rates to learn from.
